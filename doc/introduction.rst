=======
PyPSA-Distribution aims at providing a global, open, free, fully transparent, and reproducible energy system model for distribution applications.
It is based on the `PyPSA <https://pypsa.org/>`_ framework and uses the `OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>`_ data to create a detailed representation of the distribution energy system.

Examples of possible applications of the model are:

- **Microgrids planning**: The model can be used to plan the expansion of a network of microgrids, e.g. to integrate new renewable energy sources or to electrify heating and transport.
- **Distribution system planning**: The model can be used to plan the expansion of the distribution network, e.g. to integrate new renewable energy sources or to electrify heating and transport.
- **Distribution system operation**: The model can be used to operate the distribution network, e.g. to optimize the dispatch of distributed energy resources or to avoid congestions.
- **Distribution network tariff design**: The model can be used to design tariffs for the distribution network, e.g. to incentivize the use of renewable energy sources or to avoid congestions.
- **Are we missing something?**: Please let us know if you have any other ideas for applications of the model!

Workflow
========

<<<<<<< HEAD
The generation of the model is controlled by the workflow management system `Snakemake <https://snakemake.bitbucket.io/>`_. In a nutshell,
the ``Snakefile`` declares for each python script in the ``scripts`` directory a rule which describes which files the scripts consume and
produce (their corresponding input and output files). The ``snakemake`` tool then runs the scripts in the correct order according to the
rules' input/output dependencies. Moreover, it is able to track, what parts of the workflow have to be regenerated, when a data file or a
script is modified/updated. For example, by executing the following snakemake routine

.. code:: bash

    .../pypsa-earth % snakemake -j 1 networks/elec_s_128.nc

the following workflow is automatically executed.

.. image:: img/workflow_introduction.png
    :align: center

The **blocks** represent the individual rules which are required to create the file ``networks/elec_s_128.nc``.
Each rule requires scripts (e.g. Python) to convert inputs to outputs.
The **arrows** indicate the outputs from preceding rules which a particular rule takes as input data.

.. note::
    For reproducibility purposes, the image can be obtained through
    ``snakemake --dag networks/elec_s_128.nc | dot -Tpng -o workflow.png``
    using `Graphviz <https://graphviz.org/>`_
