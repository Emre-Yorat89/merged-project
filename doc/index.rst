*Motivation*. Closed-source models are the current standard for most policy and industry decisions. However, open models have proven to be
competitive alternatives that promote science, robust technical analysis, collaboration and transparent policy decision making.
Yet, two issues slow the adoption: open models are often designed with limited geographic scope, hindering synergies to collaborate,
or are based on low spatially resolved data, limiting their utility.

<<<<<<< HEAD
PyPSA-Earth is the first open-source global cross-sectoral energy system model with high spatial and temporal resolution. The workflow
provide capabilities for modelling the energy systems of any country in the world, enabling large-scale collaboration and transparent
analysis for an inclusive and sustainable energy future. PyPSA-Earth is suitable for both operational studies and capacity expansion
studies. Its sector-coupled modeling capabilities enable features for the detailed optimization of multi-energy systems, covering
electricity, heating, transport, industry, hydrogen and more.

*PyPSA meets Earth initiative* members are maintaining the *PyPSA-Earth* repository as well as many other tools.
The `website <https://pypsa-meets-earth.github.io/>`_ provides more context of the initiative and the associated projects.

=======
*PyPSA-Distribution* aims to promote open-source global energy system model at distribution scale with data in high spatial and temporal resolution.
It enables large-scale collaboration by providing a tool that can model the distribution system of any region in the world.
This work leverages on significant previous work by PyPSA-Earth, PyPSA-Eur and the references and contributions discussed in the repository.
from the European PyPSA-Eur model using new data and functions. It is suitable for operational as well as combined generation,
storage and transmission expansion studies. We work hard to extend the PyPSA-Earth model by end of this year to include sector-coupling,
myopic and perfect pathway expansion capabilities.

Example of desired studies are: microgrids planning, distribution system planning, distribution system operation, distribution network tariff design, ...
**Are we missing something?** Please let us know if you have any other ideas for applications of the model!

There are multiple ways to get involved and learn more about our work:
    1. **Join our forum** and communication platform on `PyPSA-meets-Earth <https://discord.gg/AnuJBk23FU>`__ Discord Server
    2. **Chat on Discord with us** in the following meetings:
        - General initiative meeting for project news and `high-level code updates <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r6wm2RBe0DWFngmItpFfSFHA-CnUmVcVTkIKmthdW3g/edit?usp=sharing>`__. Held every `fourth Thursday 16-17:00 (UK time) <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1naH4WwW9drkOkOJ3PLO4fyWdkZQi5-_w/view?usp=share_link>`__ and is a perfect place to meet the community and get a high-level update on PyPSA ecosystem relevant for PyPSA-Earth developments.
        - Weekly developers meetings
            - Eastern-Hemisphere friendly *Morning meeting* every `Thursday at 09:00 (UK time) <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PDdmjsKhzyGRo0_YrP4wPQkn2XTNh6jA/view?usp=share_link>`__.
